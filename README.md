# KindPath Field Kit
Public working materials for KindPath Collective:
- Whitepaper drafts
- Field Kit appendices
- Diagrams and supporting assets

## Intent
This repo exists to make the work reviewable, citeable, and improvable — without turning collaboration into chaos.

## Community
Evidence-led feedback and critique happens in Discussions:
https://github.com/S4mu3lD4v1d/kindpath-starter/discussions

## How to contribute
- Start a Discussion if you’re raising critique, proposing changes, or adding evidence
- Use Pull Requests for document edits (small and traceable)
- Use Issues in this repo only for concrete, trackable doc tasks

If you’re suggesting edits to the docs, open a Discussion first, then a PR for the change.
