# KindPath Field Kit

Public working materials for KindPath Collective:

## Intent
This repo exists to make the work reviewable, citeable, and improvable — without turning collaboration into chaos.

## Structure (recommended)

## Community
Discussion, critique, and evidence-led feedback happens here:
https://github.com/S4mu3lD4v1d/kindpath-starter/discussions

If you’re suggesting edits to the docs, open a Discussion first, then a PR for the change.
